    <h2>Newton's First Law</h2>
<pre>
    :-An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.

    <h2>Newton's Second Law</h2>
<pre>
    :-Newton's second law of motion describes the relationship between a body's motion <br> 
      and the forces acting on it. The law states that the acceleration of an object is <br>
      directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.
      This relationship is most commonly expressed by the mathematical equation:
      
               <b>F<sub>net</sub> = ma</b>
</pre>
<h2>Newton's Third Law</h2>
<pre>
    :-Newton's third law of motion, often summarized as the "action-reaction" law, states that 
      for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means forces always occur in pairs, 
      and a single isolated force cannot exist.
